Scripts that I use to do pre/post processing of ROMS model input/output:
1. Forcing/Download_ERA5_CDS_GRIB.py: this script downloads ROMS forcing fields from the ERA5 Reanalysis dataset in GRIB format. The call sign of the script is python Download_ERA5_CDS_GRIB.py year0 month0 year1 month1, where year0, month0 are the first year and first month for which data is wanted and year1, month1 are the last year and month for which data is wanted.
